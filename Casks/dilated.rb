    Beta release. Closed-lid mode is experimental.
    Not yet verified on hardware: macOS27ClosedLid, helperCrashRecovery, appCrashRecovery, guardTransitions, rebootRecovery, approvalDenied, helperUpgrade, uninstallNormalSleep, nativeUI.

    Before upgrading, run dilated prepare-update, then brew upgrade --cask dilated.
