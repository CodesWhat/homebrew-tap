  caveats <<~EOS
    Beta release. Closed-lid mode is experimental.
    Not yet verified on hardware: sudoRuleRevoked, guardTransitions, rebootRecovery, adminPromptCancelled, helperMigration, uninstallNormalSleep, nativeUI.

    Before upgrading, run dilated prepare-update, then brew upgrade --cask dilated.
    Reopen Dilated after the upgrade. Timers keep their original deadlines.
    Before removing, run dilated prepare-uninstall, then brew uninstall --cask dilated.
    Preparation expires after ten minutes. Normal uninstall preserves preferences.
